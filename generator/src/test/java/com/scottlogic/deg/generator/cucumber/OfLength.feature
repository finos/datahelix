Feature: User can specify the length of generated string data using 'ofLength'

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full



  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of length <l>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"  |
      | "aa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | <y> |
    And the following data should not be included in what is generated:
      | foo |
      | <n> |
    Examples:
      | l | y    | n    |
      | 1 | "a"  | "aa" |
      | 2 | "aa" | "a"  |


  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a numeric value < 8k on a roman alphabet character string value with length < 8k should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of length <l>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"

    And the following data should not be included in what is generated:
      | foo |
      | <n> |
  Examples:
      | l | y    | n    |
      | 1 | "aa" | "a"  |
      | 2 | "a"  | "aa" |



  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string value and white space should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of length <l>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"          |
      | "  10  10  " |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | <y> |
    Examples:
      | l  | y            |
      | 10 | "  10  10  " |


  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a numeric value = 0 on an empty string should be successful
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of length 0
    And foo is in set:
      | ""  |
      | "a" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | ""  |
    And the following data should not be included in what is generated:
      | foo |
      | "a" |


  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a numeric value > 8k on a roman alphabet character string value with length > 8k should fail with an error
    Given there is a field foo
    And foo is of length 8001
    And foo is in set:
